Caser Cipher App:
This app is similar to the symmetric encryption app. However, I've changed it so that rather than the text to be encrypted being coded beforehand, it is now an input variable so the user may input whatever word they want encrypted. I've also changed the key variable in this way so users can input a number 1 through 10 to be used for encryption. The while loop will check if the number is too high or too low and will print a warning before prompting the user to enter a key again.

SHA256 App:
This app takes a string, encodes it to bytes, gets the hexadecimal value, and prints the original string and the string after being converted to a hash. I used code from a Google search for this, though rather than using f strings to print the functions, I just used concatenation as it is my preference, and I used a different string.

Digital Signature Simulation:
Since I'm on Windows, I used the Git Bash console to use OpenSSL. Checking the version, it told me I was on OpenSSL 3.2.4 from February 11, 2025. The first step in the process after creating a new folder for all of the files was to generate the private key with the openssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 2048 command. I used this command instead of the one from the tutorial because that one seemed to not work for some reason. This gave me a PEM file with the 2048-bit RSA key pair. Then, using the openssl rsa -in privatekey.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out publickey.pem command, I extracted the public key from the private key to finish generating the key pair. I made a text document titled "example.text" with the text "I am confusion." because admittedly I was confused before finishing the process haha. Then I used the openssl dgst -sha256 -sign privatekey.pem -out sign.sha256 example.txt command to sign that text document with the key pair and it generated the sign.sha256 signature file. I also used the openssl enc -base64 -in sign.sha256 -out sign.sha256.base64 to get a readable version of the signature file just to see what it looked like. Lastly, I used the openssl dgst -sha256 -verify publickey.pem -signature sign.sha256 example.txt command to verify the signature and the console said Verified OK.
